### Introduction
<p>Card fraud is a major issue for financial institutions and consumers alike, causing billions of dollars in losses every year. Traditional methods for detecting fraud, such as rule-based systems and supervised learning, have limitations when applied to imbalanced datasets, where the number of fraudulent transactions is much smaller than the number of legitimate transactions. In this project, we propose to explore the use of unsupervised learning techniques for card fraud detection in imbalanced datasets. By leveraging the inherent patterns and anomalies in the data, unsupervised methods can effectively identify fraudulent transactions without the need for labeled data or prior knowledge of the distribution of fraud. Through a combination of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection techniques, we aim to develop a robust and effective card fraud detection system that can be applied in real-world scenarios.
